## RECREATE THE HUNTABLE SYSTEM

Huntables are objects you can collect by gazing while going through the environment. The objective of this assignment is to recreate the behavior of the Huntable system:

- In order to catch a Huntable, you have to target it long enough using the center point of the camera.
- A Huntable will only be “catchable” when a threshold distance to it is met-when you’re close enough to it. 
- There is a static white circle showing the area where you have to focus your view. 
- When you target a Huntable, a piece of UI is getting filled. If you get off focus, the filing progress is lost.
- Analyse the following gif and list every other aspect of its behavior.
- Make the fillable circle always visible (even behind objects in the scene)
